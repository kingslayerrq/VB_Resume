**The "Set It and Forget It" Job Hunt Automation System.**

This application automates the entire job application lifecycle. It works in parallel: scraping job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) AND scanning your Gmail for job alerts. It uses **GPT-4o** to tailor your resume specifically for each job description, generates a perfectly formatted PDF, uploads it to **Google Drive**, and notifies you via Discord.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Core Intelligence
* **🕵️ Dual-Engine Scraping:** Hunts for jobs on Web Boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter) AND scans your **Gmail** for "Job Alert" emails simultaneously.
* **🤖 AI Tailoring:** Supports local Ollama models or OpenAI (GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini) to tailor your resume for each job description.
* **🔍 Deep Enrichment:** Automatically visits job links found in emails to scrape the *real* job title and company name, fixing generic "LinkedIn Import" errors.

### ⚙️ Automation & Cloud
* **☁️ Cloud Sync:** Automatically uploads every generated resume to a specific folder in your **Google Drive** for easy access on mobile.
* **🧾 Notion Sync:** Optionally sync each history entry to a Notion database for tracking.
* **⚡ Daily Automation:** Built-in Task Scheduler integration to run "headless" in the background every morning.
* **🔔 Discord Notifications:** Get a summary of all generated resumes (with Drive links) sent directly to your phone.

### 📊 Dashboard
* **🎨 Dynamic PDF Generation:** Converts JSON data into professional HTML/CSS resumes using `Playwright`.
* **📈 Interactive Analytics:** Filter your history by Date, Source (Email vs Web), Company, or Status.
* **👤 Multi-Profile Support:** Manage separate identities (e.g., "Software Engineer" vs. "Game Developer") with unique settings.
